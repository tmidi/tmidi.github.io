      <description>In this post, we look dive into some of the interesting way we can use Bash to work with file names and paths, this usually helpful when you want to put a quick Bash script to copy or move/rename file. I recently had to deal with hundreds of log files generataed by the dozens of containers, the issue was each container writes logs inside a folder, but the logs files are basically have the same name inside each folder.</description>

      <description>Journald address one major issue with Linux applications logging, it provides a centralized management logging for the Kernel and the userland processes regardless where the logs are coming from. you can also use journald as an alternative looging driver inside Docker containers, this feature is available since Docker version 1.7.
To view logs written by journald you may use journalctl, it will show the full content of the journal when it&amp;rsquo;s called without parameters:  # journalctl</description>

      <description>When I am updating my Linux template, I like to delete all old logs, as a first step, I delete old rotated logs. First check how your logs are rotated and create a find command the one below to delete old rotated logs:  # Assuming my rotates logs format is : messages.2017-09-15.log find /var/log/ -name &amp;lsquo;.20.log&amp;rsquo; -delete   The command above will delete all file that match the rule, you can limit how deep you want to find files using maxdepth.</description>

      <title>OSSEC - log rotation</title>

      <description>When SELinux enabled, some OSSEC packages will fail to rotate logs under /var/ossec/logs, which will result in crontab errors and in some cases failure to write to logs.
One way to fix this is to change context type, for this let&amp;rsquo;s first check the current context:
 # Check the current SELinux context: ls -aZ /var/ossec/logs # Change SELinux context: semanage fcontext -a -t var_log_t &#34;/var/ossec/logs(/.*)?&#34; # Apply the previous context change: restorecon -R -v /var/ossec/logs # Check/confirm the context change: ls -aZ /var/ossec/logs   Command explanation:  semanage fcontext : Used to change SELinux context of files.</description>
