      <description>When I am updating my Linux template, I like to delete all old logs, as a first step, I delete old rotated logs. First check how your logs are rotated and create a find command the one below to delete old rotated logs:
The command above will delete all file that match the rule, you can limit how deep you want to find files using maxdepth. you can also use mtime +n to find files older than n days and delete them.</description>
