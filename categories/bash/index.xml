      <description>Donovan Brown wrote a good article showcasing how you can use a custom PowerShell function to navigate up directories without the need to type multiple cd .. . I find his idea interesting and could be of important time saver if you spend a lot of time working with PowerShell.
Unfortunately (or fortunately depends how you see it) nowadays I don&#39;t use PowerShell a lot, and when I do my usage is limited to few PowerCLI commands, but I do spend a considerable time interacting with Linux Shell, so the natural thing to do is to port Donovan&#39;s idea into a Bash script.</description>

      <description>In this post, we look dive into some of the interesting way we can use Bash to work with file names and paths, this usually helpful when you want to put a quick Bash script to copy or move/rename file. I recently had to deal with hundreds of log files generataed by the dozens of containers, the issue was each container writes logs inside a folder, but the logs files are basically have the same name inside each folder.</description>
