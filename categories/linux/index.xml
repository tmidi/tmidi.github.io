      <description>What&#39;s Cryptsetup? According to Cryptsetup&#39;s Gitlab project page; Cryptsetup is utility used to conveniently setup disk encryption based on DMCrypt kernel module.
These include plain dm-crypt volumes, LUKS volumes, loop-AES and TrueCrypt (including VeraCrypt extension) format.
Project also includes veritysetup utility used to conveniently setup DMVerity block integrity checking kernel module.
To install LUKS:
Activate Dmcrypt:
Create the file to encrypt:
Technically we are converting and coping a file. if: input file, we are using /dev/zero to fill the file with null characters (ASCII NUL, 0x00).</description>

      <description>When I am updating my Linux template, I like to delete all old logs, as a first step, I delete old rotated logs. First check how your logs are rotated and create a find command the one below to delete old rotated logs:
The command above will delete all file that match the rule, you can limit how deep you want to find files using maxdepth. you can also use mtime +n to find files older than n days and delete them.</description>
