## CSS syntax highlight
# (GitHub-Flavored) Markdown Editor

Basic useful feature list:

 * Ctrl+S / Cmd+S to save the file
 * Ctrl+Shift+S / Cmd+Shift+S to choose to save as Markdown or HTML
 * Drag and drop a file into here to load it
 * File contents are saved in the URL so you can share files


I'm no good at writing sample / filler text, so go write something yourself.

Look, a list!

 * foo
 * bar
 * baz

And here's some code! :+1:

```javascript
$(function(){
  $('div').html('I am a div.');
});
```

This is [on GitHub](https://github.com/jbt/markdown-editor) so let me know if I've b0rked it somewhere.


Props to Mr. Doob and his [code editor](http://mrdoob.com/projects/code-editor/), from which
the inspiration to this, and some handy implementation hints, came.
